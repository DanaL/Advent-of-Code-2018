#Advent of Code 2018
I have to learn Python not only for the Machine Learning Certificate I'm doing at York University, but because it's pretty useful in other aspects of my life (up to and including improving career prospects!). A friend sent over Advent of Code and it is the perfect small everyday task that'll get me thinking about coding.

I thought I'd keep track of what I learned every day with each set of puzzles, since I'm coming from a non-programmer background. I know some hardware Arduino/PIC C and have some vague R knowledge. Anyway, what I'm trying to say is I probably am using a lot of terms incorrectly and my code is probably a mess but hey, I'm trying.

##Day 1
Python doesn't use ++
Opening files and converting them into the data structure I want is weird
Brute force is still an effective way to solve problems if you have time and patience
